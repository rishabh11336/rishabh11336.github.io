# CORS in Flask: Bridging Frontend and Backend

In the dynamic realm of web development, Flask, a prominent web framework, often assumes the role of the backend in applications interacting with diverse frontends. However, a crucial security aspect called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) becomes essential when the frontend and backend reside on different servers/domains.

CORS acts as a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain. In the case of Flask, which inherently disallows cross-origin requests for security reasons, configuring CORS is imperative when the backend services/APIs are accessed by frontends hosted on distinct domains.

## Why CORS in Flask?

By default, Flask restricts cross-origin requests to align with the security model of web browsers. However, in scenarios where the frontend and backend exist on separate domains, CORS configuration becomes a necessity. This involves specifying which domains are permitted to access resources on the server, ensuring secure data exchange.

```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)  # app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(
    app,
    resources={
        r"/*": {
            "origins": "http://localhost:5173",
            "supports_credentials": True,
            "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": True,
        }
    },
)
```

## Configuring CORS in Flask

Flask facilitates CORS configuration through extensions like Flask-CORS, allowing developers to specify allowed domains, request methods, and headers. This level of control ensures that only trusted frontends can interact with the Flask backend, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

In the realm of web development, understanding and implementing CORS in Flask is indispensable for ensuring secure communication between frontends and backends. With this security feature in place, developers can fortify their applications against potential threats while maintaining seamless integration between different components (frontend & backend). CORS serves as a bridge, enabling the connection of frontend and backend technologies in a secure and efficient manner.
